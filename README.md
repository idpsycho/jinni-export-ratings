Allows you to export your ratings to use with any other movie database.
And now it can also import those ratings into imdb!
To export from jinni.com, you have to be in your ratings page http://www.jinni.com/user/YOUR_USER_NAME/ratings/ and logged in.
To import into imdb.com, you have to be in http://www.imdb.com/list/ratings and logged in.


### HOW TO USE (browser extension/user-script)
Install following extension into browser: <a href="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/jinni-exporter-extension.user.js">Jinni-Exporter-Extension.user.js</a>

- Firefox - simply click on the link
- Chrome - download the file, open extension manager (Menu/Tools/Extensions), then drag the file in there
- Opera doesnt work (if it ever works, here is extensions <a style="display: none;" href="http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/#writingscripts"> how to</a>)
