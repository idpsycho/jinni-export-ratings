# Jinni.com Ratings Exporter
Allows you to export your ratings to use with any other movie database.
You have to be logged in to jinni.com, and be in your ratings page: http://www.jinni.com/user/YOUR_USER_NAME/ratings/ .
(tested in Chrome and Firefox. However in Opera it doesnt work, dunno why)


## HOW TO (as a bookmarklet)
Drag this link into your bookmarks: <iframe style="width: 100px; height: 20px; display: inline; overflow: hidden;" src="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/jinni-exporter-bookmarklet.htm"></iframe> (<a href="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/jinni-exporter-bookmarklet.htm">or from this page</a>)
You have to call this for every page of your ratings (it should automatically go to the next page to make it super-easy).
