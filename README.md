# Jinni.com Ratings Exporter
Allows you to export your ratings to use with any other movie database.
You have to be logged in to jinni.com, and be in your ratings page: http://www.jinni.com/user/YOUR_USER_NAME/ratings/ .
(tested in Chrome and Firefox. However in Opera it doesnt work, dunno why)


## HOW TO (bookmarklet)
Drag bookmarklet from <a href="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/">this page</a> into your bookmarks (toolbar).
You have to call this for every page of your ratings (it should automatically go to the next page to make it super-easy).


## HOW TO (console script)
1. Copy the script from <a href="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/jinni-exporter.js">here</a>.
2. When on your ratings page, open the browser console and run the script from there.
3. You have to run this for every page of your ratings (it should automatically go to the next page to make it super-easy).


## HOW TO (browser extension/user-script)
Install following extension: <a href="http://p.brm.sk/jinni-exporter/jinni-exporter-extension.user.js">Jinni-Exporter-Extension.js</a>
(in Chrome, you have to download the file, then open extension manager, then drag the file in there. for other browsers, use google)
